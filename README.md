# HikeShare
I'm imagining something like a Goodreads site for hking.

I'll get some mock-ups together (probably on paper for now, since I'd feel weird about using the moqup account for this). But first
version would probably involve pictures, descriptions, and being able to search and share hikes (and being able to 'friend' other users).

I'll be working through tutorials (like https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-mvc-app-xplat/) to learn things about
ASP.NET and MVC and building this out as I find the things needed. But I'm sure you'll be able to work at a quicker pace and it'd be fun
to work on it together so if you want to build something out on your own don't worry about me understanding it first.
